Use YOURLS (a free GPL URL shortener service) or another public service (tinyURL...) to create short URL of your posts and tweet them

== Description ==

[YOURLS](http://yourls.org/ "Your Own URL Shortener") is a free URL shortener service you can run on your webhost to have your own personal TinyURL.

This plugin is a bridge between [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/ "Your Own URL Shortener"), Twitter and your blog: when you'll submit a new post or page, your blog will tap into YOURLS to generate a short URL for it, and will then tweet it.

Note that, for maximum fun, this plugin also supports a few other public URL shortener services: tr.im, is.gd, tinyURL and bit.ly
